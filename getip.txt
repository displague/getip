EXAMPLES
	C:\>getip vhrudtTZTzT.T
	set MYVER=.4a
	set IP=141.232.80.58
	set NET_ID=80
	set HOSTNAME=e30675

	set CTIME=mon jan 04 15:49:30 1999
	set CTIME=Mon Jan 04 15:49:30 1999
	C:\>getip fd c:\autoexec.bat fp \\server\share\path\path2\file.ext
	set FILEDATE=1998.10.28
	set SERVER=server
	set SHARE=share
	set FILEPATH=path\path2
	set FILENAME=file.ext
	C:\>getip R HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE...\ProgramFilesDir
	set REGVAL="C:\Program Files"

	-- or as a login script --
	@echo off
	 getipwin rhTu fp %0>%temp%\t.bat
	 call %temp%\t.bat
	 echo %CTIME% %USERNAME% Logged in to %HOSTNAME%>>%windir%\mydomain.log
	 if "CONN_TOT" == "1" goto remote
	 if NOT "%SERVER%"=="" set source=\\%server%\%share%
	 if "%SERVER%"=="" set source=%DRIVE%:
	 if NOT "%FILEPATH%"=="" set source=%source%\%filepath%
	 %source%\someoperation.exe
	 %source%\somemore.exe
	 call %source%\updates.bat
	goto end
	:remote
	 echo Remote connection detected - keeping it quick.
	:end

FILE FUNCTIONS
	The file compare functions return errorlevels to make it easier to
	use in a batch script.

	ex: getip fn c:\autoexec.bat c:\config.sys

	if autoexec.bat is newer or the same as config.sys, 0 will be returned
	if autoexec.bat is older than config.sys, 1 will be the errorlevel
	if autoexec.bat or config.sys are missing, 0 or 1 will be returned 
	 indicating which is the existing file.
	if autoexec.bat or config.sys are there but not accessable 
	 (no permission), then 2 will be returned..
	
	REM test.bat This demonstrates how to use the file functions of getip
	getip fn c:\progra~1\mcafee\scan.exe \\server\software\mcafee\scan.exe
	if ERRORLEVEL 2 goto error
	if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto setup
	goto end
	:setup
	  \\server\software\mcafee\setup
	goto end
	:error
	  echo Scan is not accessable, please inform the network administrator
	:end
